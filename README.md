# Expo Config Plugins

- A collection of [Expo config plugins](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/config-plugins/) for configuring the `expo prebuild` command.
- This repo is to Expo config plugins as [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) is to TypeScript.
- We prefer packages ship their own Expo config plugin (to ensure versioning is aligned), but if they haven't adopted the system yet, the community can add a package here.
- All packages here are community maintained. Feel free to improve docs, packages, tests, etc.
- We maintain a 1-1 mapping of **native packages** â‡” `@config-plugins/*`. This means there should be no general utility packages here -- those are better suited for a different repo / NPM namespace.
