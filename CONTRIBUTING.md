# Contributing to Expo Config Plugins

## Submitting a pull request

To submit a pull request:

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/expo/config-plugins) and create a feature branch. (Existing contributors can create feature branches without forking. Prefix the branch name with `@your-github-username/`.)
2. Run `yarn` in the root directory to generate the build files.
3. Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) including in the PR title.
4. Fill out the entire PR template. Ensure your code is tested locally and has continuous tests in CI.
5. Make sure all tests pass on GitHub Actions.
6. Wait for a review and adjust the code if necessary.

## Creating a plugin

- Plugins can be generated by running `yarn gen`.
- Add plugins to the example in [`apps/app`](/apps/app/package.json) to test them.
- The example app should always stay in a state of regeneration.

Be sure to run the following scripts in the **root directory** to update automation tools:

- Update dependabot: `yarn update-dependabot-config`
- Update the issue template: `yarn update-issue-template`

## Publishing a release

All publishing should be handled automatically whenever code is merged to `main`.
